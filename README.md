# UGMC Electronic Medical Record System

## Endpoints

### 1. Register a new patient

- **Endpoint:** `POST /registerPatient`
- **Request body:**
  ```json
  {
    // Patient data fields
  }


### Step 3: Run and Test
1. Make sure your Express server is still running (`node index.js`).
2. Use a web browser, Postman, or a similar tool to send a GET request to `http://localhost:3000/patients`.
3. Verify that you receive a response with a list of patients in JSON format.

By following these steps, you'll add functionality for doctors to view a list of patients in your Electronic Medical Record System. Feel free to test it, and let me know if you encounter any issues or have any questions!
